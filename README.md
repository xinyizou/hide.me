# Hide.me

Hide.me is a OpenCV and Tensorflow pipeline for image anonymization. Given the increased use of facial recognition to arrest protestors (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/defund-facial-recognition/613771/), it is more important then ever to anonymize social media posts not only for personal safety but also the safety of those who may not have given consent for their photo to be taken

Hide.me works through various levels of anonymization including blurring of identifying features like faces and tattoos or art style transfer to make it difficult for facial recognition technology to track personal information
